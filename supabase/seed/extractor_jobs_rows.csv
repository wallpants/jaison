This is Candace from C com. The reason for my call today is about the form you filled out on our website for our fiber plans. Have I caught you at a good time?\nSpeaker 0\t00:00:18\tUh, for now it's fine, but I might be busy soon, but we can talk about it now.\nSpeaker 1\t00:00:22\tPerfect. First I'd like to quickly confirm your address and see if it's part of our serviceable locations. What we have here is 1 1 3 4, 5 keys Spruce Way, San Antonio, Florida 3 3 5 7 6. Is this correct?\nSpeaker 0\t00:00:37\tThat's correct.\nSpeaker 1\t00:00:39\tPerfect. So this address is eligible for a fiber connection. We can provide you with a service. Would you like to know more about our available plans?\nSpeaker 0\t00:00:48\tUm, actually I was just curious if my location's serviceable for fiber, but I'm not, I'm not really actively looking to switch right now. I'm kind of happy with my current provider. So\nSpeaker 1\t00:01:00\tI understand, uh, this is just gonna be a discovery call to see if there are areas that we might be able to help you out with. If I could just ask you real quick, how much is the average speed you're getting from your current provider?\nSpeaker 0\t00:01:11\tUm, I'm not sure. I haven't really checked.\nSpeaker 1\t00:01:14\tAnd what's your current provider?\nSpeaker 0\t00:01:17\tBCNC.\nSpeaker 1\t00:01:18\tAnd what do you usually use your connection for? Browsing, gaming, streaming,\nSpeaker 0\t00:01:23\tUm, all sorts of things, but mainly just browsing, FaceTime and streaming most of all. Mm-Hmm,\nSpeaker 1\t00:01:30\t<affirmative>. And are you totally happy with how the speed performs for each of these activities or do you think it could be better in some aspects?\nSpeaker 0\t00:01:37\tUh, I would say totally happy, but mostly it's acceptable when watching videos at 4K. There's definitely some lagging, doesn't matter which device on our phone, so on our TV it would just freeze for a few seconds and then resume. I'm guessing it's the connection because it's definitely not the device. We just bought this 4K TV last month and it's been happening like clockwork every time we're watching 4K. Other than that, it's fine.\nSpeaker 1\t00:02:02\tHmm. You know, in streaming 4K videos you normally need 25 megabits per second to effectively load without lagging. Anything lower than 25, it would definitely slow you down one way or another.\nSpeaker 0\t00:02:12\tOh really? I wasn't exactly aware of that.\nSpeaker 1\t00:02:15\tTell you what, Vanessa, why don't we test your connection and see how much speed you're exactly getting because I think you're getting less than 25 or if you are, chances are it's not a consistent 25 throughout the day. Are you in front of your computer right now?\nSpeaker 0\t00:02:29\tNo. But now that you raised that, I'm actually curious since I haven't really checked the speed before. Huh uh Alright, lemme just go to my computer. What do you want me to do?\nSpeaker 1\t00:02:39\tSo if you could just open a browser and go to speed task.net.\nSpeaker 0\t00:02:43\tUhhuh <affirmative> speed task.net. Okay.\nSpeaker 1\t00:02:49\tAnd then click go once you're there.\nSpeaker 0\t00:02:51\tOkay. It says, oh wow, this thing's moving.\nSpeaker 1\t00:02:56\tYep. That's the meter. The first number should be your download speed.\nSpeaker 0\t00:03:02\tOkay. It says eight point 19 mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And there's another wheel coming up. I guess that'll be the upload speed.\nSpeaker 1\t00:03:08\tYep. That'll be the upload speed.\nSpeaker 0\t00:03:10\tHuh? So now it says 17.43, so nine point 19 and 17.43. So definitely not enough, huh?\nSpeaker 1\t00:03:19\tNo, definitely not enough to load 4K. You know, when you're streaming videos, we need to look at your download speed, how much megabits you're downloading from the web per second. Okay. Your download speed is eight point 19. That's good enough for 10 80, but definitely not for 4K because you see 4K, technically it's four times the size of 10 80, so that's like 2 million pixels versus 8 million pixels per second.\nSpeaker 0\t00:03:42\tOh wow. So that explains the lagging then.\nSpeaker 1\t00:03:45\tOh, definitely. There's no doubt about it. And that's what I'm calling you about today, Vanessa. If you wanna make the most out of your 4K TV than have something much faster for you with an attractive pricing.\nSpeaker 0\t00:03:57\tOkay.\nSpeaker 1\t00:03:58\tYou could get up to 800 megabits per second, which is roughly a hundred times faster than your current download speed. Would you like to know more about the available plans?\nSpeaker 0\t00:04:08\tWell that sounds great, but how much is it?\nSpeaker 1\t00:04:11\tIt depends on the plan, but 800 megabits per second starts as slow as $50 per month plus installation fees.\nSpeaker 0\t00:04:20\tUm, okay. I, I don't know, that's kind of too much for me. I, I don't think we're willing to pay that much. Our internet is a little slow, but it works for us most of the time. So, um, I don't think so.\nSpeaker 1\t00:04:33\tOkay. How much do you pay monthly for your current connection?\nSpeaker 0\t00:04:37\tAbout 30, $33, something like that. Uh, that's kinda like my price range. I don't think I wanna be paying any higher than that.\nSpeaker 1\t00:04:44\tOkay. Okay. I get you. Let me check here. Okay. Because I might have something more suitable for you.\nSpeaker 0\t00:04:51\tOh, okay.\nSpeaker 1\t00:04:54\tOkay. What if I tell you you can get 100 megabits per second for only $25 with free installation fee?\nSpeaker 0\t00:05:02\t$25 For how much? How much speed?\nSpeaker 1\t00:05:05\t100 megabits Not as fast as 800, but definitely 12 times faster than your current download speed. More than enough to play 4K and cheaper than $33. How does that sound?\nSpeaker 0\t00:05:17\tHmm. That's getting interesting. Um, but first I'm gonna have to talk to my husband about it. Mm-Hmm, <affirmative>. I also have to go to work now. Can you call me later after work this evening?\nSpeaker 1\t00:05:29\tSure. I can call you back at six or seven this evening. Which do you prefer?\nSpeaker 0\t00:05:34\tSeven. Should be fine.\nSpeaker 1\t00:05:35\tAlright then. Thank you for your time Vanessa. I'll call you back at seven in the evening today. Have a good day.\nSpeaker 0\t00:05:41\tYou too.

So definitely not enough, huh?\nSpeaker 1\t00:03:19\tNo, definitely not enough to load 4K. You know, when you're streaming videos, we need to look at your download speed, how much megabits you're downloading from the web per second. Okay. Your download speed is eight point 19. That's good enough for 10 80, but definitely not for 4K because you see 4K, technically it's four times the size of 10 80, so that's like 2 million pixels versus 8 million pixels per second.\nSpeaker 0\t00:03:42\tOh wow. So that explains the lagging then.\nSpeaker 1\t00:03:45\tOh, definitely. There's no doubt about it. And that's what I'm calling you about today, Vanessa. If you wanna make the most out of your 4K TV than have something much faster for you with an attractive pricing.\nSpeaker 0\t00:03:57\tOkay.\nSpeaker 1\t00:03:58\tYou could get up to 800 megabits per second, which is roughly a hundred times faster than your current download speed. Would you like to know more about the available plans?\nSpeaker 0\t00:04:08\tWell that sounds great, but how much is it?\nSpeaker 1\t00:04:11\tIt depends on the plan, but 800 megabits per second starts as slow as $50 per month plus installation fees.\nSpeaker 0\t00:04:20\tUm, okay. I, I don't know, that's kind of too much for me. I, I don't think we're willing to pay that much. Our internet is a little slow, but it works for us most of the time. So, um, I don't think so.\nSpeaker 1\t00:04:33\tOkay. How much do you pay monthly for your current connection?\nSpeaker 0\t00:04:37\tAbout 30, $33, something like that. Uh, that's kinda like my price range. I don't think I wanna be paying any higher than that.\nSpeaker 1\t00:04:44\tOkay. Okay. I get you. Let me check here. Okay. Because I might have something more suitable for you.\nSpeaker 0\t00:04:51\tOh, okay.\nSpeaker 1\t00:04:54\tOkay. What if I tell you you can get 100 megabits per second for only $25 with free installation fee?\nSpeaker 0\t00:05:02\t$25 For how much? How much speed?\nSpeaker 1\t00:05:05\t100 megabits Not as fast as 800, but definitely 12 times faster than your current download speed. More than enough to play 4K and cheaper than $33. How does that sound?\nSpeaker 0\t00:05:17\tHmm. That's getting interesting. Um, but first I'm gonna have to talk to my husband about it. Mm-Hmm, <affirmative>. I also have to go to work now. Can you call me later after work this evening?\nSpeaker 1\t00:05:29\tSure. I can call you back at six or seven this evening. Which do you prefer?\nSpeaker 0\t00:05:34\tSeven. Should be fine.\nSpeaker 1\t00:05:35\tAlright then. Thank you for your time Vanessa. I'll call you back at seven in the evening today. Have a good day.\nSpeaker 0\t00:05:41\tYou too.
