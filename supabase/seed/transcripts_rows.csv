There's definitely some lagging, doesn't matter which device on our phone, so on our TV it would just freeze for a few seconds and then resume. I'm guessing it's the connection because it's definitely not the device. We just bought this 4K TV last month and it's been happening like clockwork every time we're watching 4K. Other than that, it's fine."",""speaker"":""Speaker 0"",""timestamp"":""00:01:37""},{""content"":""Hmm. You know, in streaming 4K videos you normally need 25 megabits per second to effectively load without lagging.

What do you want me to do?"",""speaker"":""Speaker 0"",""timestamp"":""00:02:29""},{""content"":""So if you could just open a browser and go to speed task.net."",""speaker"":""Speaker 1"",""timestamp"":""00:02:39""},{""content"":""Uhhuh <affirmative> speed task.net.

That'll be the upload speed."",""speaker"":""Speaker 1"",""timestamp"":""00:03:08""},{""content"":""Huh? So now it says 17.43, so nine point 19 and 17.43. So definitely not enough, huh?"",""speaker"":""Speaker 0"",""timestamp"":""00:03:10""},{""content"":""No, definitely not enough to load 4K. You know, when you're streaming videos, we need to look at your download speed, how much megabits you're downloading from the web per second. Okay. Your download speed is eight point 19. That's good enough for 10 80, but definitely not for 4K because you see 4K, technically it's four times the size of 10 80, so that's like 2 million pixels versus 8 million pixels per second."",""speaker"":""Speaker 1"",""timestamp"":""00:03:19""},{""content"":""Oh wow. So that explains the lagging then."",""speaker"":""Speaker 0"",""timestamp"":""00:03:42""},{""content"":""Oh, definitely. There's no doubt about it.

I, I don't know, that's kind of too much for me. I, I don't think we're willing to pay that much. Our internet is a little slow, but it works for us most of the time.

How much do you pay monthly for your current connection?"",""speaker"":""Speaker 1"",""timestamp"":""00:04:33""},{""content"":""About 30, $33, something like that. Uh, that's kinda like my price range. I don't think I wanna be paying any higher than that."",""speaker"":""Speaker 0"",""timestamp"":""00:04:37""},{""content"":""Okay. Okay. I get you.

How much speed?"",""speaker"":""Speaker 0"",""timestamp"":""00:05:02""},{""content"":""100 megabits Not as fast as 800, but definitely 12 times faster than your current download speed.
